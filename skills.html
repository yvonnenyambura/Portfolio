   <h1>My Skills</h1>
   <img src="coding.jpg" alt="coding picture">
   
   <p>I have a background in journalism with strong skills in research, storytelling, and communication, a deep interest in human psychology that drives my empathy and user-focused thinking, and I’m currently expanding into software engineering through a hands-on bootcamp, where I’m developing technical skills in full-stack development, problem-solving, and collaborative coding.
