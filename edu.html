 <h2>From Storytelling to Software: My Journey</h2>
 <p>My journey began at Mount Kenya University, where I pursued a degree in Journalism and Mass Communication. There, I honed the art of storytelling, learned how to connect with audiences, and developed a deep appreciation for the power of clear, impactful communication.

But as the world grew increasingly digital, so did my curiosity. I realized that stories weren’t just told through words—they were also built into the apps, platforms, and systems we use every day. That realization sparked a new passion: technology.

Now, I'm at Zindua School, diving into software engineering. I’m learning how to craft not just messages, but digital experiences—how to solve problems with code, build scalable solutions, and bring ideas to life through technology.

My background gives me a unique edge: I can communicate complex ideas simply, collaborate effectively, and approach tech challenges with creativity and empathy. I’m not just switching careers—I’m blending the best of both worlds.
