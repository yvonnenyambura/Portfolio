    <h3>MY EDUCATION</h1>
<BOdy>I studied Journalism and Mass Communication at Mount Kenya University,where I discovered <br> how much I enjoy telling stories and connecting with people.Right now,I'm at Zindua School <br>diving into Software Engineering~I love the challenge of building things that are not just <br>functional but also feel human and meaningful.I'm excited to see where these two worlds meet.</BOdy>
